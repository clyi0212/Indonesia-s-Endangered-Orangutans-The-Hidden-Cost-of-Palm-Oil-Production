# Indonesia's Endangered Orangutans: The Hidden Cost of Palm Oil Production

## Background Introduction

This project shines a light on the significant profits generated by the Indonesian palm oil industry, which come at the expense of orangutan survival. Its purpose is to engage and educate a broad audience, including environmental conservationists, wildlife advocates, and those interested in sustainable practices. The project is structured around five key themes, each designed to progressively convey the importance of adopting sustainable palm oil practices. Data-driven insights underscore the urgency of the issue and highlight the irreplaceable nature of the solutions.

### Key Themes:

1. **The Omnipresence of Palm Oil**  
   - **Figure 1** tracks global production trends for major vegetable oils from 2010 to 2020.  
   - **Figure 2** illustrates how palm oil is found in numerous everyday consumer products, demonstrating its widespread use and the growing demand.

2. **Indonesia’s Role in Palm Oil Production**  
   - **Figures 3 to 6** focus on Indonesia’s dominant role in palm oil production.  
   - The growth of palm oil production from 1961 to 2020 is highlighted, particularly Indonesia’s increasing share of the market.  
   - These figures also showcase the extensive deforestation in Sumatra and Kalimantan, where forests have been cleared for palm oil plantations.

3. **Impact on Orangutans**  
   - **Figures 7 and 8** illustrate the encroachment of palm oil plantations on orangutan habitats between 2001 and 2019.  
   - A choropleth map and an infographic depict how these plantations have contributed to orangutan mortality.

4. **Benefits and Challenges of the Palm Oil Industry**  
   - **Figures 9 to 12** highlight both the benefits and challenges of the palm oil industry.  
   - Palm oil’s superior yield compared to other crops is shown, alongside the large workforce employed in plantations, especially in Sumatra and Kalimantan.  
   - This section concludes with a summary of key points, emphasizing the challenges in implementing sustainable practices.

5. **The Solution: Sustainable Palm Oil Production**  
   - The final section introduces the **Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)**, an organization that certifies sustainable palm oil production.  
   - **Figure 12** provides an infographic detailing the stakeholders involved in RSPO certification and the eight principles of sustainable palm oil.  
   - This section encourages readers to support sustainable palm oil by seeking out the RSPO logo when making purchasing decisions.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to raise awareness about the environmental and ecological impacts of the palm oil industry. By providing actionable recommendations and promoting the adoption of sustainable palm oil practices, the project aims to contribute to a more sustainable future.

## How to Open the Project

To properly open and run this project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Pip**: Ensure that you have pip, Python's package installer, installed. If you have Python installed, you can verify pip by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip --version
Live Server: You will need to install a Python HTTP server or a live server to run this project. We recommend using Live Server extension for Visual Studio Code or setting up a Python HTTP server.

To install the Live Server extension for VSCode:

Open Visual Studio Code.

Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).

Search for "Live Server" and click "Install."

Alternatively, you can run a basic Python HTTP server using these commands:

For Python 3.x:

bash
Copy
python -m http.server
This will start a server on port 8000. You can access the project in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:8000.

Steps to Open the Project
Clone or Download the Repository:

If you haven't already, clone the repository using Git:

bash
Copy
git clone DECO3100_ywan5525_A2-Interactive Visualisation Project_Indonesia's Endangered Orangutans-The Hidden Cost of Palm Oil Production 2.git
Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file from GitHub and extract it.

Navigate to the Project Folder:
After downloading or cloning the repository, navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy
cd Indonesia-s-Endangered-Orangutans-The-Hidden-Cost-of-Palm-Oil-Production
Install Dependencies (if applicable):

If the project has dependencies (e.g., specific Python libraries or other resources), you can install them by running the following command:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
If there is no requirements.txt, ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed, such as matplotlib or plotly for data visualization.

Start the Live Server:

Open the project in Visual Studio Code (or your preferred code editor) and start the Live Server.

Alternatively, if you are using Python's built-in server, run the following command in the project directory:

bash
Copy
python -m http.server
Open the Project in Your Browser:

After starting the server, open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000.

This will display the project page where you can interact with the data visualizations and learn about the environmental impact of palm oil production.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, try the following:

Ensure all dependencies are installed by following the steps above.

If the page doesn’t load, check the terminal for error messages and ensure there are no conflicts with ports.

Make sure your browser is not blocking any content required to view the visualizations.

Feel free to check the issues section of this repository if you need further assistance or encounter bugs.
